							<h3>Position in the Project</h3>
							<p>
								In this project I am the Enemy Lead Engineer, so I am the one who is in charge of planning out and managaing the Ai Team to ensure that we deliver on our vision for combat with the enemies.
								For the first part of the project I was in fact the only one on the Ai team so with the exception of the body i made all the foundational Ai functions and worked closely with the Player/Combat team to implement the features they made for the player and would then enable the Ai to do the same or simialar behavior.
							</p>
							<h3>Enemy Group Behavior</h3>
							<p>
								The largest part of the Ai that I am in charge of and that can largely dictate the Ai's behavior is the Group Behavior system that I created.
								This Group Behavior system is designed from the ground up to ensure that while fighting large groups of enemies that they contuine to act in a fun and responsive manner.
								This is accevied through creating Group Attack Tokens that are then passed around by the enemies to allow them to attack. This is done so that only some enemies can be attacking at one time rather than all of them.
								The behavior is shown below but at the time of writing it is constantly being improved upon to make the enemies feel more natural and fun to fight.

							</ul>
							<p>
								Another recent change to the Ai in the project that I worked on was giving them blocking functionallity while another member of the team worked on Dodging.
								The Blocking now being fully functional is being improved on how long it lasts and when it activates as at the moment it is a bit to simplistic.
